[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Ends Truce by Warning ‘Incompetent’ Democratic Party](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/08/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ends-truce-by-warning-incompetent-democratic-party)

> “It’s really hard for us to turn out nonvoters when they feel like nothing changes for them. When they feel like people don’t see them, or even acknowledge their turnout,” Ocasio-Cortez said.
>
> “If the party believes after 94% of Detroit went to Biden, after Black organisers just doubled and tripled turnout down in Georgia, after so many people organised Philadelphia, the signal from the Democratic party is the John Kasich won us this election? I mean, I can’t even describe how dangerous that is.”

Let's set aside the fact that AOC is said to be the one ending the truce here, when that is not the case. Never-Trump Republicans and establishment democrats haven't stopped punching left. 

But that aside, this is what I want to see from her right now. Fighting for policy the majority of the country wants isn't divisive. The Left can't keep playing the game of compromising with the right, when millions of lives hang in the balance.
