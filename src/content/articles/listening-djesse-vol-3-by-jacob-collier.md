I don't remember when I first heard of Jacob Collier, but I became an instant fan. I mean, go watch [his Tiny Desk Concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPBirt1YhuM), or [watch him do one of his Logic session breakdowns](https://youtu.be/sRIjprauHgk), or [hear him dissect a Stevie Wonder song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZP6nogQYPg) with a knowledge about music that'll just blow you away. No matter which one of those links you click, you'll quickly catch on that Jacob is nothing short of a musical genius.

_Djesse Vol. 3_ is listed in the Jazz genre, but I can't really tell you what it is. It's a mix of many different sounds, and pulls it off masterfully. The album also happens to be full of some fantastic collaborations with Mahalia, Tori Kelly, Ty Dolla $ign, Kiana LedÃ©, and Daniel Caesar among others.

This is one I definitely recommend you listen to in headphones.

**My favorites:**

1. All I Need (with Mahalia & Ty Dolla $ign)
2. Running Outta Love (feat. Tori Kelly)
3. Sleeping on My Dreams
