I was so excited to see Ty Dolla $ign come out with a new album. I'm a new fan of Ty honestly. He's featured on some of my favorite tracks recently and I've fallen in love with his delivery and versatility. His voice is like butter, and I feel like he has such a good feel for what a track needs from him.

This album shows that Ty is more than just a feature. While many of these songs have an impressive list of artists accompanying him, the album shows off Ty's ability to switch from buttery melodies to raps and back. In the end, it's an impressive showcase of both Ty's skill and his contact list.

**My favorites:**

1. Your Turn (feat. Musiq Soulchild, Tish Hyman & 6LACK)
2. Ego Death (feat. Kanye West, FKA twigs & Skrillex)
3. Everywhere
4. Spicy (feat. Post Malone)
