There hasn't been much to be excited about this year, so I'm looking forward to season two of *The Mandalorian*. Lots of rumors are circling about the contents of this season, but I mostly like to wait and see for myself. One thing is for sure, we'll finally see Ahsoka Tano in live-action, and I'm certainly hyped. She's easily one of my favorite characters in all of *Star Wars*, and I anxiously await to see what Rosario Dawson does with the character.

The new season of *The Mandalorian* starts streaming on Disney+ on October 30th.
