[The latest episode](https://anchor.fm/AmpedUp/episodes/The-Peoples-Party-gets-Amped-Up-with-Ryan-Knight-egio4n) of @ProudSocialist's podcast is a _must listen_ and has me excited about @4apeoplesparty. Demanding Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, and defuding the police isn't divisive, it's the right thing to do. If democrats can't support those policies, we need a party that does.
