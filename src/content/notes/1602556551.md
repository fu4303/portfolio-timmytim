[Meet the new owners of Clearleft](https://clearleft.com/posts/meet-the-new-owners-of-clearleft)

> Our new owners are Alex, Chris and Tom. They’re James, Helen and Cassie; Lorenzo, Trys and Maite. I could go on but you see where we’re going here. The new owners of Clearleft are the people who power Clearleft and who make Clearleft so special. It’s our whole team, in the form of an **Employee Ownership Trust**.
> 
> That’s right; Clearleft will be run for—and on behalf of—all our team, now and in the future. So rather than working for a company where the benefits go to a handful of individuals, they will be shared evenly amongst the team.

A whole-hearted congratulations to everyone at Clearleft on this wonderful news. This is the way of the future.
