[Democrats Arenâ€™t Entitled to the Latino Vote](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/09/joe-biden-latino-vote-latin-america-democrats):

> At the Democratic National Convention, Hispanic speakers were [noticeably absent](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/08/dnc-features-latinos-key-2020-voter-demographic-200819162439956.html) from the proceedings, with [one wit noting](https://twitter.com/SawyerHackett/status/1295433510933626885) that there were more Republicans slotted on day one alone than Latinos the entire week. Considering the fact that Joe Biden lost the Hispanic primary vote badly to Bernie Sanders, the failure to even engage in the typical prime-time pandering is difficult to fathom.
