[No Honeymoon for Joe Biden](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/11/joe-biden-administration-opposition-push-left)

> If there was ever a case where the victory of the lesser evil over the greater evil merited busting out a bottle or two of champagne, this was it. But once you’ve sobered up, remember that being less evil than Trump is fully compatible with being an implacable enemy of the working class. The incoming Joe Biden administration doesn’t deserve an ounce of credit for having the right intentions or a day of progressives patiently waiting to see how it acts before pivoting to a posture of opposition.

I enjoyed this article. The historical context for why we should be in opposition to Biden from day one makes a lot of sense too.
