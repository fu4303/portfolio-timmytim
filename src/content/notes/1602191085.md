Sent in my ballot yesterday. I voted for @howiehawkins and @AngelaNWalker. They support Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, ending the war on drugs by legalizing marijuana, $2000/month UBI as part of their COVID relief plan, community control of the police, and so much more. I'm so proud to have voted for two working class people that are fighting for policies we need.
