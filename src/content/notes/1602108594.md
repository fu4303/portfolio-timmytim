One of the best purchases I've made this year is my [26 oz. Yeti Rambler](https://www.yeti.com/en_US/drinkware/rambler-26-oz-bottle-with-chug-cap/21071200034.html#start=1). I take it everywhere with me, it doesn't alter the taste of your drink, and you can feel good about eliminating yet another single-use plastic.
