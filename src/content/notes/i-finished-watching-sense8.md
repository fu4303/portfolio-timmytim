I finished watching _Sense8_ today and what a wonderful ride of a show it was. I wish the series would've been given more time, but they wrapped it up pretty well. The whole show is an ode to what we can be when we're motivated by love rather than fear. If you haven't watched the series, I wholeheartedly recommend it.
