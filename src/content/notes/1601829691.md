[Religious fundamentalists can’t be trusted with child protection](https://www.secularism.org.uk/opinion/2020/09/religious-fundamentalists-cant-be-trusted-with-child-protection)

> …if you approach an inquiry like IICSA on the basis that anyone who asks probing questions or criticises your organisation should be barred, what you're really saying is: if somebody says something you don't want to hear, they should be deprived of their legal rights. Clearly, no organisation exhibiting this attitude or behaviour can be trusted to protect the human rights of a child who might want to say something critical about the organisation or somebody powerful within it.
