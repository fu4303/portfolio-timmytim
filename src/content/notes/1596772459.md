> The study, which was published in the journal [Preventive Medicine](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091743520302097), concluded that men who scored at the high range were up to twice as likely to be at risk for suicidal or depressive tendencies, and up to 5 times more likely to engage in sexual harassment, cyberhassment, and physical or verbal bullying.

[This article from _them_](https://www.them.us/story/toxic-homophobic-men-more-likely-to-have-mental-health-issues) makes it clear ==men need to urgently unlearn toxic masculinity==. Personally, I've decided to detach who I am from my gender. I don't care about being "a good man." ==I want to be _a good human==, and that means a commitment to self-improvement, growth, kindness, and above all, infinite and unconditional love.
