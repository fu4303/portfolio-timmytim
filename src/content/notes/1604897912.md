[Working people delivered Biden his victory. Now he needs to deliver for them.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/11/08/working-people-delivered-biden-win-nina-turner/)

> But the result was also a warning for Biden: In the midst of overlapping national crises, his administration has a critical window to deliver for the working people and young people who got him elected. If he fails to meet the moment — if he seeks instead to return us to a “normalcy” marked by corporate handouts and extreme inequality — then the next Trump might be far more dangerous than the one we just defeated. We can see hints of this already in the way voters of color — perennially taken for granted by the Democratic Party — shifted marginally toward Trump in 2020. Though they still carried Biden to victory by a [46-point margin](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2020/exit-polls/presidential-election-exit-polls/?itid=lk_inline_manual_8), the lesson is clear: The Democratic Party ignores its base at its own peril.
