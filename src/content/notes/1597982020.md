So [the truth is out](https://twitter.com/sawyerhackett/status/1296584700950175751?s=21): the DNC didn’t give @AOC ANY time. She only had time at the convention because Bernie asked her to second his nomination. How much clearer does it need to be that the Democratic Party doesn’t care about progressives? We need @4aPeoplesParty.
