I just added dark mode to my personal site and uh‚Ä¶ it's pretty gorgeous if I do say so myself üòç Dark mode colors are so fun to come up with, yet surprisingly most of them were already being used in the light theme. 

Tap on Artoo and he'll toggle the modes for you. It also respects the `prefers-color-scheme` media query. Shout out to ‚Ä™@hankchizljaw‚Ä¨ for [nudging me in the right direction](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/gorko/issues/4) on GitHub and [his great article](https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/create-a-user-controlled-dark-or-light-mode/) on the topic too.

Hope you like it ‚ù§Ô∏è
