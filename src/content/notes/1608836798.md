This year has been a shit show to say the least. I'm glad it's coming to an end, but the crises we face unfortunately won't suddenly vanish with a new year. Still, it's more important than ever to take a second and be thankful for the things we can be thankful for, and celebrate happiness in the moments we can.

Happy holidays to you and yours. May you have a restful and refreshing holiday ❤️
